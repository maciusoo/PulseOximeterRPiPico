# Pulse Oximeter Project

A low-cost, reliable pulse oximeter designed using optoelectronic and photonic components. Built with the Raspberry Pi Pico and powered by AAA batteries, this device measures blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and heart rate (BPM) in real-time and displays the data on an OLED screen.

## Project Overview

This project is a student-built pulse oximeter that detects blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate using a phototransistor and alternating red/IR LEDs. It leverages a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and an SSD1306 OLED display, enclosed in a custom-designed mechanical casing.

---

## Theoretical Background

Pulse oximetry relies on the differential absorption of red and infrared light by oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. This project uses a phototransistor to measure the light transmitted through a fingertip from alternating red (660nm) and IR (940nm) LEDs.

---

## Assumptions

### Functional
- Real-time SpO₂ and BPM monitoring.
- Battery-powered, portable, and user-friendly design.

### Design
- Red and IR LEDs, phototransistor for detection.
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 for signal processing.
- 0.96" OLED screen for GUI.

## Hardware Description

- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico 2
- **Sensors:** Red and IR LEDs, SFH 313 FA phototransistor
- **Display:** OLED SSD1306 (128x64)
- **Power:** 3 × AAA batteries (4.5V)
- **Enclosure:** Modified hair clip inside a custom box

### Electrical Schematic

- LEDs connected to GPIO via 100Ω resistors
- Phototransistor output read by ADC pin
- I2C used for OLED communication (GP4 and GP5)

---

## Software Overview

### Language
- **MicroPython**

### Key Features
- Real-time calculation of SpO₂ and BPM
- Dynamic thresholding for heartbeat detection
- Graphical display of signal trends

### Core Functions
- `calculate_spo2()`: Estimates SpO₂ from red/IR ratios.
- `calculate_bpm()`: Measures pulse rate from signal peaks.
- `normalize()`: Maps signal values for OLED plotting.
- `set_threshold()`: Adapts threshold based on signal range.

### GUI
- OLED shows:
  - SpO₂ (%)
  - BPM
  - Graphs for red and IR light
- Updates every 50 ms using `ssd1306` library

## Start-up and Calibration

Initial testing with a 9V battery caused overheating. The final design uses 3 × AAA batteries connected directly to the VSYS pin of the Pico. Components were later soldered for improved reliability.

## Tests and Measurements

### Hardware Tests
- Measured current/voltage to verify connections.
- Verified resistor values and LED functionality.

### Software Tests
- Validated LED toggling and signal acquisition.
- Chose optimal GUI layout after multiple iterations.

### Specifications

- **SpO₂ Accuracy:** ±2%
- **BPM Accuracy:** ±10 BPM
- **Sampling Rate:** ~20Hz
